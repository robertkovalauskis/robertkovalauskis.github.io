  Hello! I'm a Test Automation Engineer with 3 years of experience in Agile projects. During this time I mostly worked with <mark>Java</mark> and <mark>C#</mark> programming languages and developed test automation using frameworks like <mark>TestNG</mark> and <mark>NUnit</mark>.
  
  I have experience in developing a <mark>Selenium 4</mark> test automation framework from scratch and deploying <mark>Selenium Grid</mark> in <mark>AWS</mark> using <mark>Docker</mark> for running tests in the Cloud.
  
  I also have several certifications, including the <mark>ISTQB Foundation level</mark>, which gave me a structured overview of the role and <mark>best practices</mark> of testing in the <mark>Software Development Life Cycle</mark>.
  
  What I like the most about my job is that it requires me to constantly grow professionally and obtain new skills. I also like to communicate with my teammates to find solutions to the challenges we have.
